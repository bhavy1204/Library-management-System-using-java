## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library with details like title, author, and ISBN.
- **Issue Books**: Issue books to library members.
- **Return Books**: Handle book returns and update inventory.
- **View Inventory**: Display the current list of books available in the library.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Member Management**: Add and manage library members.
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses **SHA-256 hashing** to securely store and verify passwords.
