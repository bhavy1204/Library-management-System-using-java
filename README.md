A **real-life relatable** Library Management System built using Java. This project is currently under development and aims to provide a secure and efficient way to manage library operations such as adding books, issuing books, returning books, and tracking inventory. It uses **SHA-256 hashing algorithms** to ensure password security, avoiding hard-coded credentials for enhanced safety.

## Introduction

This project is a **Library Management System** designed to help librarians manage books and members efficiently. It provides a console-based interface for performing various operations like adding books, issuing books to members, returning books, and viewing the current inventory. The system is designed to be **secure and user-friendly**, making it suitable for real-life library management scenarios.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library with details like title, author, and ISBN.
- **Issue Books**: Issue books to library members.
- **Return Books**: Handle book returns and update inventory.
- **View Inventory**: Display the current list of books available in the library.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Member Management**: Add and manage library members.
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses **SHA-256 hashing** to securely store and verify passwords.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for development.
- **SHA-256 Algorithm**: For securely hashing and storing passwords.
- **Git**: For version control.

---

## Security Features

- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, ensuring that no passwords are stored in plain text or hard-coded.
- **No Hard-Coded Credentials**: The system avoids hard-coding any sensitive information, making it more secure and adaptable for real-world use.
